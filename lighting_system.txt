
# Smart Light System Using Arduino

This Arduino project simulates a basic home automation system. The system reads the ambient light level through an LDR sensor. When it gets dark (light value drops below a certain threshold), it automatically turns on a light source.

## Components Used:
- Arduino UNO
- LDR Sensor
- 10k Resistor
- LED
- (Optional) Relay Module

## Features:
- Automatic light control based on room brightness.
- Can be expanded for real relay and smart light systems.
- Built and tested using Tinkercad.

## Skills Demonstrated:
- Sensor input reading
- Conditional logic
- Hardware simulation
